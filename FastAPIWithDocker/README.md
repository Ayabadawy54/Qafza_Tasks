## ðŸš€ About the Project
This project demonstrates the use of Docker to containerize a Machine learning FastAPI application. By using Docker, I ensured that the application can run seamlessly across different environments.


## ðŸ›  Features
Containerized Application: Built using Docker for easy deployment.
Environment Independence: Run the application consistently across different systems.
Docker Hub Image: Easily accessible for anyone to pull and use.


## ðŸ“¦ Pull the Docker Image
To use the pre-built image, run the following command:

bash
docker pull [your-docker-hub-username]/[image-name]:[tag]
[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ayabadawy/fastapi_dockertest/general]



## ðŸ”§ How to Build and Run Locally
If you prefer to build and run the image locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd [repository-folder]
Build the Docker image:

bash
docker build -t [your-image-name] .
Run the Docker container:

bash
docker run -d -p [host-port]:[container-port] [your-image-name]

## ðŸ“š Skills Learned
As part of the Qafza Training Program, I developed the following skills:

- Containerization with Docker: From image creation to container orchestration.
- Docker Hub Integration: Pushing and pulling images to/from Docker Hub.
- Application Deployment: Ensuring a consistent runtime environment.
